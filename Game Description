Game Title: Escape the Chainsaw Man

Greetings from Chainsaw Chase: Get Out of the Maze! In this thrilling and challenging maze exploration game,
your goals are to find items, escape the maze, and survive. The Chainsaw Man is after you, and the maze is perilous.
Before it's too late, you'll need to think fast, stay on your feet, and find out how to get out.

You begin your adventure by navigating dim halls and looking for chests located throughout the maze. 
Two important items are found in these chests: a lamp and a gun. If you encounter the Chainsaw Man directly, 
you can defend yourself with the gun, and the lantern lights your way so you can see what lies ahead. 

The ultimate goal is to find the key to the locked door and escape the maze, but there’s a catch. 
To get the key, you’ll have to defeat the Chainsaw Man. This is no easy task—he’s fast, dangerous, and relentless. 
You can choose to sneak around, run away, and avoid combat, or face him head-on using your gun and skill. 
It’s all about strategy, smart choices, and quick reflexes.
